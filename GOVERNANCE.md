# Governance

A design system isn't a components folder and a `tokens.json` file — it's a product, and
the teams building Cedar Grove's client portal, internal tools, and marketing site are its
users. Alla Kholmatova's *Design Systems* makes the case, backed by interviews with dozens
of teams, that systems don't usually fail because a button was styled badly. They fail
because nobody owned the decision, review happened inconsistently (or not at all), and
drift crept in until the "system" was just documentation nobody trusted. The artifacts —
tokens, components, this document — are the easy part. Who's accountable for them, and how
a change gets from idea to shipped, is the part that actually determines whether this stays
alive or rots.

**Nothing in this document is ratified.** Cedar Grove hasn't agreed to any of this yet —
it's a proposed starting model, sized deliberately for a firm at this stage rather than
borrowed wholesale from an enterprise design-systems team with a dozen dedicated staff. Read
it as a strong recommendation to accept, adjust, or override, not a policy already in force.

## 1. Ownership

**Recommendation:** a small design systems working group — one design co-owner, one
engineering co-owner, jointly accountable. Neither is a full-time role; both keep their
regular work and treat this as a standing responsibility layered on top, reviewed together
roughly every cycle.

Day to day, whoever's "on point" that cycle reviews most incoming changes alone — that's
what keeps the model from becoming a bottleneck. The two co-owners' judgment is what
settles anything contested: a disagreement over whether a change belongs in this system at
all, or whether it's ready to ship. The alternative worth naming and rejecting is
**diffuse ownership** — "everyone on the team owns the design system." Kholmatova's research
treats this as functionally equivalent to no ownership at all: without a specific person
whose job it is to notice drift and say no, nobody does, and the system quietly stops
matching what's actually in the product. A single named owner (no co-owner) is the other
real alternative; it's simpler, but it puts a bus factor of one under both the design and
engineering sides of every review, which is a bad trade for the redundancy a two-person team
buys.

One thing this model should **not** flex on: content and copy changes go through the exact
same review as a token or component change, not a lighter one. As the Storybook
introduction puts it, a perfectly accessible button with the wrong words on it still fails
the client. Treating copy as a lower-stakes edit than a hex value is exactly the kind of
drift this group exists to prevent.

## 2. Contribution model

Not every change needs the same ceremony. Three tiers, scaled to how much a change can
break for someone downstream:

| Tier | Example | Process | Turnaround |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **(a) Typo / copy tweak** | Fixing a misspelled label, rewording an error message to match Voice & Tone | Direct PR, one reviewer | Same day |
| **(b) New component, token, or content page** | Adding a `Combobox` primitive, a new spacing token, a UI Copy Patterns entry | PR + a design review + an engineer familiar with the existing pattern, checked against the "what done looks like" list in the Storybook introduction | Normal review cycle |
| **(c) Breaking change** | Renaming or removing a token, changing a component's public API | A short written proposal first (3–4 sentences: what's changing, why, who's affected), *then* a PR, plus a migration note in the changelog | Deliberately slower |

Most contributions should land in (a) or (b) — that's the system working as intended.
Tier (c) should be **rare by design**: if breaking changes are showing up often, that's a
signal the API surface wasn't designed conservatively enough up front, and the working
group should treat it as a prompt to slow down on the *next* addition, not just wave the
current one through. The proposal step for (c) is deliberately lightweight — four sentences,
not a design doc — because the point is forcing a moment of "does anyone affected know this
is coming," not adding process for its own sake.

## 3. Versioning

**Recommendation:** semantic versioning on the token/component package — `patch` for fixes
and non-breaking additions, `minor` for new components or tokens, `major` for breaking
changes, exactly as semver is meant to be read by anyone depending on it.

Every release also gets a **plain-language changelog entry**: what changed, and why it
matters to whoever's consuming the package — not a pasted list of commit messages. This is
the same instinct behind GOV.UK's content guidance: never state a rule without the reason a
person would need to act on it correctly. Compare:

- **Not this:** `fix: various button tweaks`
- **This:** "`Button`'s default variant now meets 4.5:1 contrast against `bg-muted` (previously
  3.8:1). If you've overridden the default variant's background color, check contrast
  against your override before upgrading — the built-in default is no longer the value
  you may have measured against."

The second version tells a consumer whether *they* need to do anything. The first doesn't,
and that gap is exactly what turns a routine upgrade into an unpleasant surprise later.

## 4. Deprecation

**Recommendation:** never remove a token or component in the same release that introduces
its replacement. Mark the old one deprecated, keep it working for at least one full minor
version, and only remove it in a subsequent major — with the removal called out explicitly
in that release's changelog, not buried in a diff.

For example: if `bg-primary-strong` is introduced to replace the ad hoc `cedar-700` alias,
`cedar-700` gets flagged deprecated in that same minor release but keeps working. It's only
actually removed at the next major version, and that major's changelog says so in plain
language, with a pointer to what replaces it. This gives every consuming team a real window
to migrate on their own schedule instead of a hard break they discover at build time.

## 5. When content and components disagree

This will happen, and it's worth settling the rule before it does rather than re-litigating
it every time: a component ships with default copy — placeholder text, a button label, an
error string — that conflicts with current Voice & Tone or UI Copy Patterns guidance. Shopify
Polaris is the model worth following here, in that its content guidance is documented
directly against the components it governs rather than filed away separately where nobody
thinks to check it.

**Resolution: content guidance wins for anything product-facing.** A component's default
copy is a starting example for what the prop could hold, never a mandate baked into the
component itself. If a `Dialog`'s example destructive-confirmation copy says "Are you sure?"
and the current guidance calls for naming the consequence directly ("Delete this matter?
This can't be undone."), the guidance wins, the product surface gets updated, and — if the
default is genuinely misleading rather than just an example — the component's default string
gets a follow-up fix too. That follow-up is ordinarily a tier (a) or (b) change under the
model above, not a breaking one, unless it requires changing the prop's shape rather than
just its default value.

---

None of the five decisions above are locked in. If a different ownership shape, a faster
tier (c) process, or a different deprecation window fits Cedar Grove better once this is
actually in use, this document should change to match — the working group it proposes is
exactly the body that would make that call.
